# Extending and Implementing Process Mining Techniques Improving Data Quality - Prevention and Mitigation 
___

## Description

Process mining, a subfield of data science, focuses on analyzing event data recorded during process execution. Handling substantial amounts of process-related data requires robust analytical techniques. Ensuring data quality is paramount in process mining, and a pattern-based strategy is employed to systematically address various data quality issues. In this project, team will propose  solution with the Odigos framework in process mining initiatives provides a systematic approach to identify the root causes of data quality problems making the steps towards preventing and mitigating data quality issues in event logs.
